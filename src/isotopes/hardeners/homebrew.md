# Homebrew

## What it Does

Installs `/usr/local/bin/brew` as a small setuid/setgid Automic Vault launcher
for `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`.

The root phase creates the `automic` user and `vault` group when needed, owns
`/opt/homebrew` as `automic:vault`, and installs the launcher as
`06755 automic:vault`.

## Details

- This targets Apple Silicon Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew`.
- Existing `/usr/local/bin/brew` files are left alone unless they are already
  the Automic Vault brew stub.
- `/usr/local/bin` must precede `/opt/homebrew/bin` in `PATH`. After hardening,
  run `hash -r` or start a new shell so it does not keep using a cached path to
  the original `brew` executable.
- Every launcher invocation is authorized by the menu bar app before Homebrew
  runs. Read Only Access approves known inspection commands automatically and
  prompts for writes or unknown commands; Read & Update Access additionally
  approves `brew update` and is the default; No Access prompts for every
  command, while Full Access approves every command automatically.
- The launcher fails closed when the approval service is unavailable.
- The stub clears the environment, restores only safe terminal/locale values,
  and executes `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` directly.
